  	<p style="font-size: 2rem;">It's our understanding that foreign fungal spores inhabiting an astroid fell to earth and reawoke nature. The spores seemed to enhanced every plant it came into contact with. Photosynthesis efficiencies were at levels never before seen. Nature was suddenly improving on itself. The trees grew faster and taller. Their bark grew thicker as well. It was only a matter of time before nature started to encroach on humanity.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">In a matter of weeks, entire cities were getting swallowed by the ever growing forests. The woods became as wild as the animals. New species of flora and fauna seemed to appear overnight. The earth became unrecognizable. There was a lot to learn about the new world. New types medicines and food could be discovered right in your backyard. Around that time new materials and technologies designed to tame this new world started to get worked on.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Specially designed robots with mighty tools and weapons were created to reclaim the cities of old. That made nature angry. The more the trees and vines were cut the more nature seemed to bite back. Some strange new diurnal and nocturnal predators started appearing. Man seemed to be the target. Humanity suddenly had it's back against the wall. What was left of the world powers of old united mankind to come together to reclaim the planet. World peace was achieved and the smartest and brightest around the world were all united under the goal to protect humanity. For the first time, the forest could be stopped.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">There was a new renaissance of art, science and technology. Artificial intelligence was said to be rediscovered. Air could have weight and light could be solid. Man became bold once again. New robots were created to claim the new world. Other robots were designed to rebuild civilization. For the first time in a long time, large stretches of land could be cleared for the exploding human population. Man became so bold that we thought we could control nature once again.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">New chemicals and techniques were developed to reduce the efficiency of the plants to grow and reproduce. In a controlled setting, most plants were said to grow like they once did. The land around the new cities were sprayed with these chemicals to help keep the ever growing forest at bay. Over several generations, it was observed that some of the animals that existed around the plants with treated soil were behaving differently. Cases of wild attacks were reported. The rabid animals studied had millions of unique fungal spores on their fur and in their lungs. It was as though the earth itself was starting to decay. Panic and fear gripped the hearts of many. No one could agree on a solution to the new fungal growth. It was as if all of nature had declared war on mankind once again.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">More and more decisions by the world leaders were made out of haste and fear. Information and freedom eventually became illegal. A civil war broke out and the end result was self annihilation. One by one the new world cities sank into the earth. Nature claimed the land once again. What was left of mankind evacuated the cities and are now living off the land. Civilization is over. Many ideas and technologies are slowly being forgotten. World history is becoming more and more a distant memory.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center; font-size: 2.5rem;">Mason Story</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Voice: I don't know how we didn't see this coming. The signs were everywhere. We let history repeat itself.</p>
    <i style="font-size: 2rem;">*opening credits*</i>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Voice: We had no warning for the fall of civilization. There were signs but we never knew the extent of our actions. We never thought our solution to the problem would be all of our demise. When our city sank into the earth so did all of our hope for a better world. I don't know how many made it out but we did. The first thing we built was a shelter. It wasn't much but it was our new home. We managed to get a connection to the grand exchange network. It made us think that civilization wasn't as far gone as we once thought it was. Before we could use the grand exchange, we needed something to trade. Luckily we made camp next to a huge scrap heap. I know we could eventually find everything we needed in that heap.</p>
    <i style="font-size: 2rem;">*get scrap*</i>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Voice: Once we had some scrap to sell, we needed to decide how we wanted to advance. We could start by getting better at scrapping so we could find better scrap or we could invest in bartering on the grand exchange so we can get better prices for our scrap.</p>
    <i style="font-size: 2rem;">*make an upgrade*</i>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Voice: If we wanted to guarantee our survival we needed to build a factory. With a factory we could use the scrap to make robots again. The woods are deadly for humans these days. If we were going to get better equipment, we need to go out and find better scrap and these robots are the only ones who can get it with a chance of coming back.</p>
    <i style="font-size: 2rem;">*build a factory*</i>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Our first robots were crude to say the least but they did the job and kept us safe. We used some of the scrap we could find to make the different parts needed to create a robot. All robots share one thing in common: they all have two arms, two legs, a body and a head.</p>
    <i style="font-size: 2rem;">*create a robot*</i>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem;">With the first robot made, it was time to send it out on a mission. Back at the base, we have a map of the known world. We could send our robots around the perimeter of our base or all the way to the forgotten cities. For our first mission, we had it stay near by. I hope it makes it back alright...</p>
